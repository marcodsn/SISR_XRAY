# Generative vs. Discriminative Approaches to X-Ray Upscaling: From U-Net to Denoising Diffusion

This repo contains the code used for the group project of the Deep Learning course at UNIUD (2025/2026).

As part of this project, we explored and compared generative and discriminative models for the task of X-Ray image upscaling. We implemented a U-Net architecture as a discriminative model and a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) as a generative model. The performance of both models was evaluated using various metrics to determine their effectiveness in enhancing the resolution of X-Ray images.
